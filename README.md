This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js, designed to showcase my projects and professional experience as a front end developer. The project uses TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations. The backend is powered by Strapi CMS to manage and deliver content seamlessly.
